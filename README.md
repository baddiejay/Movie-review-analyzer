# Movie review analyzer

Python script realized as the second group project by me and my classmates Simone Damiano and Maria Antonietta De Carlo for the artificial intelligence course at Federico II university, year 2019/2020

Movie review analyzer returns, given a review, the percentage of confidence with which it considers positive or negative that review. To do so, the reviews are first reprocessed through the NLTK text processing library and then the AI is trained with a dataset of reviews so it can predict the outcome.
